## Question: Explain the difference between shallow clone and deep clone, then implement a function to deep clone an object.

### First of all, what is a copy?

- A copy just looks like the old thing, but isnâ€™t. When you change the copy, you expect the original thing to stay the same, whereas the copy changes.

In programming, we store values in variables. Making a copy means that you initiate a new variable with the same value(s). However, there is a big potential pitfall to consider: deep copying vs. shallow copying. A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable. A shallow copy means that certain (sub-)values are still connected to the original variable.[^1]
