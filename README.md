## Question: Explain the difference between shallow clone and deep clone, then implement a function to deep clone an object.

### First of all, what is a copy?

- A copy just looks like the old thing, but isnâ€™t. When you change the copy, you expect the original thing to stay the same, whereas the copy changes.

- In programming, we store values in variables. Making a copy means that you initiate a new variable with the same value(s). However, there is a big potential pitfall to consider: deep copying vs. shallow copying. A _deep_ copy means that all of the values of the new variable are _copied and disconnected from the original variable_. A _shallow_ copy means that _certain (sub-)values are still connected to the original variable_.[^1]

- Examples of shallow coping

  1. `var newObject = oldObject`
  2. `var newObject = [...oldObject]`
  3. `var newObject = Object.assign({}, oldObject)`


- On this project we'll implement two versions of deep coping

  1.  Basic version which will not work for functions and circular reference situation. `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObj))`
  2.  Advanced version which will recursively traverse the original Object "Please check deepCloneAdvanced function in deepClone.mjs file"
